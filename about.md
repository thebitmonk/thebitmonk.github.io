I am a Software Developer at [Rovi](http://rovicorp.com) working on
their mobile team. Prior to this I worked at a tech startup - [Snapstick](http://www.fenwick.com/experience/pages/fenwick-represents-snapstick-in-$20-million-acquisition-by-rovi.aspx) where I was
making a multiplayer platform so to control Smart TVs and PCs using smartphone and tablets
as controllers, pretty similar to [Chromecast](http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromecast/index.html).

 I am a full stack developer who dabbles with design and business. My new found love is distributed systems and 
functional programming. My motto is getting **1% better everyday**. Like what I write or have something interesting to share ? Give a hoot at **varunjain003@gmail.com**. Peace.
