title: About
---

I am a data engineer at [Indix](http://indix.com) working on some interesting and hard problems related to analytics, search and distributed data systems. 
Prior to this I worked at a tech startup - [Snapstick](http://www.fenwick.com/experience/pages/fenwick-represents-snapstick-in-$20-million-acquisition-by-rovi.aspx) where I was
making a multiplayer platform so to control Smart TVs and PCs using smartphone and tablets
as controllers, pretty similar to [Chromecast](http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromecast/index.html). Snapstick was later acquired by
[Rovi](http://rovicorp.com) where I worked in the mobile team.

I am a full stack developer who dabbles with design and business. My new found love is distributed systems and 
functional programming. Also I play with a lot of languages primarily because they expose me to new viewpointsof attacking a problem. 
My current favorite is Go although I like power of Scala ( especially for data systems and despise it also for its HUGE grammar ) and keep on hopping 
between C++, python and Objective-C based on the problem at hand.

My motto is getting **1% better everyday**. Like what I write or have something interesting to share ? Give a hoot at **varunjain003@gmail.com**. Peace.
