title: Culture Matters
---
In my experience, more than anything else, culture defines the success and failure of a company. Anything and everything which happens in an organization is deeply linked to the set the core values which every employee breathes and lives. It is sort of an unwritten code which makes a tribe of smart & passionate people work towards achieving a common goal. Yet very few companies take time out to define them and to ensure that they are percolated down to the last employee.

Rather than defining what a culture is I am listing down attributes that I think make a great culture:

### Do always the right thing and not the easy thing
It is always so easy not to have that uncomfortable conversation. People dread debating when there are ideological differences and are too eager to accomodate and say yes rather than explaining their point of view properly. It is too easy to add one extra button, a 3 line hack to get a feature running or to skip following best practices just to get things out of the door quickly.

### Keep learning
As software artists our job is not just to get things done but to get them done really well.To develop these *Jedi* powers we need to hone our art & craft. All good programmers I know are consumed with learning and becoming better at what they do everyday, day in day out. This is not a sprint, its a marathon. 

### Teach
[Pay it forward culture](http://steveblank.com/2011/09/15/the-pay-it-forward-culture/) should be the norm and not the exception. Be that in the form of open sourcing your code, teaching a fellow co-worker to ramp up, writing blog posts or giving tech talks.

### Respect & Smile
These are the two things that get forgotten way too often. Respect your art and your co-workers. You may be exceptionally talented but no one likes to work with a jackass, however smart they may be. Last time I checked writing software was still a collaborative work.
Smile and smile often. Happiness matters afterall.

Companies that inspire me and which I believe have a great culture are [Basecamp](http://signalvnoise.com/), [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/) and [Github](https://github.com).

On a side note this is a very interesting presentation shared by the wonderful guys at Hubspot :
